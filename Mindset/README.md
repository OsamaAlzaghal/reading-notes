# Mindset notes

## Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice.
One told me that practice makes perfect and the field of IT depends on practicing what you learned more than just reading especially new techs cause they are new and lack resources so you have to try them yourself before anyone else.
If you ever feel comfortable that means you are not doing enough and you have to push yourself more to be better and reach the highest and best version of yourself.

## The power of believing that you can improve.
No one can't improve, even if the results are small. You have to continue that small work and keep building it until the time comes and to see your efforts. The pain and suffering means you are doing it right, so just keep believing and working hard and you will get there! Stop complaining about the things happend to you and change yourself cause you can adapt.

## The power of passion and perseverance.
