# Technical documentation

## How to get an overview of a technical document?

1. Establish why you are reading it
2. Get an overview of the content and structure of the document
3. Take 30s to 2 minutes to scan the rest of the document. Click on the scrollbar and just breeze through all the pages. Just look at the pictures, tables and diagrams. Look for things that look familiar and that you will understand immediately. APIs, schematics, flow charts, block diagrams. Read the captions under the pictures.
4. If you want, stop at the interesting parts and take a deeper look. Stop when it gets boring.

5. Look at the table of contents again. You'll have a deeper understanding of the document after you look again.

6. Choose what to read next based on interesting-ness or usefulness. If there's nothing useful, close the doc. You can say that you've read it from cover to cover.

## How do online payments via credit or debit card work?

The process for businesses to accept credit or debit card payments online from customers involves several entities and many steps. Before we explore these in further detail, let’s briefly define some key terms:

+ Merchant account - A specific type of bank account required for a business to accept credit or debit card payments from customers. (Learn more about merchant accounts later in this guide.)

+ Issuer (A.K.A. issuing bank) - A financial institution that provides credit or debit cards to its customers. In the context of this guide, think of it as the customer’s bank.

+ Card association (A.K.A. card network) - A collection of member financial institutions that process card payments based on an agreed set of rules. Major examples are Visa and Mastercard.

+ Acquirer (A.K.A. acquiring bank or merchant bank) - A financial institution that processes a transaction based on information from the issuer and card association. They provide businesses with merchant accounts, and are licensed members of card associations.

+ Payment processor - A term often attributed with varying definitions. In the context of this guide, a payment processor is the facility of an acquirer which transfers transaction details to the relevant card association. (Learn more about payment processors later in this guide.)

+ Payment gateway - Software that facilitates the transfer of a customer’s card details from a merchant’s website to a payment processor. 

From the customer completing the merchant’s checkout process, through to the merchant receiving the funds in their bank account, the overall process for online credit and debit card transactions takes place in two broad stages - authorisation, and clearing and settlement.
